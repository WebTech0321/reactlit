## What is Reactlit?

Reactlit is a headless, micro-app framework for React inspired by the simplicity of
python's [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and modeled on the
API of [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/platform/framework).
A Reactlit is a React component that you can add to your existing React app.
It takes an async function in which you can define your UI procedurally.

Take a look at the following example to see how it works

### Hello World Example

import { Code, Card } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import helloWorldCode from '/src/examples/hello-world.tsx?raw';
import textInputCode from '/src/examples/inputs/basic-text-input.tsx?raw';
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Hello World">
    <Code
      lang="tsx"
      title="hello-world.tsx"
      code={helloWorldCode}
      showLineNumbers
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="TextInput">
    <Code
      lang="tsx"
      title="inputs/basic-text-input.tsx"
      code={textInputCode}
      showLineNumbers
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**See it live:**

import HelloWorld from '/src/examples/hello-world.tsx';

<Card>
  <HelloWorld client:only="react" />
</Card>

## Why procedural UI?

By defining UI procedurally you can treat your UI as functions that return data.
This makes it easier to read and understand what the code is doing. Modern hook-based
React has a lot of complexity. You have to know when to memoize, you have
to follow the rules of hooks and declare their dependencies. Reactlit can't compete
with the flexibility of React, but for many simpler use cases, it offers a higher-level
abstraction that can result in code that is simpler and often shorter as well.

By implementing this abstraction in pure React, you can reuse your existing
React application and all of its components.

Let's rewrite the same example as above, but this time we'll use native React.

import helloWorldReactCode from '/src/examples/hello-world-react.tsx?raw';

<Code
  lang="tsx"
  title="hello-world-react.tsx"
  code={helloWorldReactCode}
  showLineNumbers
/>

While similar in length, in order to read through this code you have to jump
around. The state gets instantiated on line 4, but then set down on line 13 and used
on lines 5 and 12. Notice how some of these are above the set and some are below.
There are many ways to write this logic and the code can be ordered in many ways.
This leads to a less consitent experience when reading the code.

Especially when dealing with and responding to a lot of user input, the React model
can be cumbersome. Reactlit is designed to give you another option in these situations.
