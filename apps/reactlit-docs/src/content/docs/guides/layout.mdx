title: Layout Plugin
description: How to use the layout plugin
---

By default, Reactlit uses a simple layout system where each `display` call
concatenates a `ReactNode` to the DOM. This works great for simple applications,
where you are ok just showing your content in a single column,
but as your application grows, you may want to have more control over the layout.

The plugin provides a `layout` helper function to let you define more custom layouts with
your Reactlit script.

import { Card, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

  Currently this plugin is provided in the core package, but this may change in
  the future.

The `layout` function works via the [tunnel-rat](https://github.com/pmndrs/tunnel-rat)
library. It takes a number of slots to expose and a render function that defines how
those slots are layed out. Then, for each slot, it returns a mini-context with
`view` and `display` functions that render specifically within that slot.

This is a bit abstract, so let's look at an example.

import layoutExampleCode from '/src/examples/layout-example.tsx?raw';
import threeColumnLayoutCode from '/src/examples/layouts/three-column-layout.tsx?raw';
import { Code, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Layout Example App">
    <Code
      lang="tsx"
      title="layout-example.tsx"
      code={layoutExampleCode}
      showLineNumbers
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Layout Definition">
    <Code
      lang="tsx"
      title="layouts/three-column-layout.tsx"
      code={threeColumnLayoutCode}
      showLineNumbers
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

import LayoutExample from '/src/examples/layout-example.tsx';

<Card>
  <LayoutExample client:only="react" />
</Card>
