description: Learn how to use managed state in Reactlit.

By default, Reactlit manages state internally for you. However, you can also
manage the state of the application yourself. This is useful if you want to
persist parts of the state in different ways, i.e. in localStorage or in query params.

The state a Reactlit takes is not exactly the same as what you get from a `useState` hook.
Instead, it is an object made of several independant states. For this reason, we provide a
few built-in hooks to help you manage the state of your application.

## Simple State

Here is a basic example of managed state which sets default state for the application.
The `useReactlitState` hook is a wrapper around `useState` that allows you to set
default state for the application.

```tsx
import { Reactlit, useReactlitState } from '@reactlit/core';

function MyApp() {
  const [appState, setAppState] = useReactlitState({
    name: 'Jason',
    favoriteColor: 'red',
  });
  return (
    <Reactlit state={appState} setState={setAppState}>
      {({ view, display }) => {
        const name = view('name', TextInput);
        const favoriteColor = view('favoriteColor', TextInput);
        display(`${name}'s favorite color is ${favoriteColor}`);
      }}
    </Reactlit>
  );
}
```

## Compound State

Sometimes, you want to manage state differently for different entries in the state object.
For this, you can use the `useCompoundReactlitState` hook.

It takes two arguments, the first is an object that maps keys to a `useState`-style state-and-setter tuple.
The second argument is the default state and setter for all other keys. Here is how you can
combine it to customzie the state management for your application.

```tsx
const [appState, setAppState] = useCompoundReactlitState(
  {
    user: useQueryParam('user'),
    bio: useLocalStorage('bio'),
  },
  useState({
    email: '',
  })
);
```

This composes nicely with [transform views](/guides/basics#transform-views) whereby you can
return a full user object for a view, but the state will only store the userId.
