Reactlit works by defining an application script. This script procedurally builds the UI, inserting elements
into the DOM as needed. Similar to how Streamlit works, every state change reruns the script which
in turn re-renders the UI. Reactlit employs a few tricks to try to minimize re-renders so that you should not
see any flickering or lose focus state.

## Primitives

Reactlit core provides the following set of primitives to use in your application script.

### Display

The `display` function is used to render a React node.

```tsx
display(<div>Hello World</div>);
display(`Hey there`);
display(
  <div>
    <Spinner /> Loading...
  </div>
);
```

It can optionally take an first argument string to be an id for the display.
This allows later code to update the display.

```tsx
display('loading-data', <div>Spinner /> Loading...</div>);
const data = await fetchData();
display('loading-data', <div>Data loaded!</div>);
// or alternatively, this to clear the prior display
display('loading-data', undefined);
```

### Set State

The `set` function is used to set state. Most of the time you will not need to
use it directly, instead you will use the `view` function below, but it is necessary on occasion.
Additionally the raw `state` object is also provided as part of the context.

```tsx
set('mystate', 'Hello World');
const mystate = state.mystate;
```

### View

The `view` function is used to render an input view which has state and to return that state.
Think of it as a special form of `display` with a return value.

The first argument is the key of the view. This determines which state key the value will be stored in.

The second argument is the view definition. Some built-in view definitions are provided in the add-on packages like
`@reactlit/vanilla` and `@reactlit/radix`. Or you can define your own as described in the [Defining Views](/guides/defining-views) guide.

The follow examples assume you have imported the `Inputs` object from the `@reactlit/radix` package.

```tsx
const name = view(
  'name',
  Inputs.Text({ label: 'Name', placeholder: 'Enter your name' })
);
const color = view(
  'color',
  Inputs.Select(['red', 'green', 'blue'], { label: 'Pick a color' })
);

display(
  <div>
    {name} picked {color}
  </div>
);
```

Views are type-safe and the types are determined by the view definition itself.

#### Transform views

Some views define a `getReturnValue` function which transforms the value returned by the view.
Transforms allow the state you want to store (what you would get back from the `get` function) to be different
from the value that is returned to work with. This is especially useful for elements like tables where
the selected state should be some kind of a row id, but the view should return the full row data.

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Aside>
  By storing only the id in state, the user selection can be maintained even if
  mutations update the other data in the row.
</Aside>

Assuming you have a variable `users` which is an array of user objects, you can define a view like this:

```tsx
const selectedUser = view(
  'user',
  Inputs.Table(users, { getRowId: (row) => row.userId })
);
const selectedUserId = state.user;
display(
  <div>
    Hello {selectedUser.name}. Your id is {selectedUserId}
  </div>
);
```

### Changed

Sometimes you need to trigger side-effects when state changes. In React, we have `useEffect` to handle this.
The equivalent in Reactlit is a `changed` function which tells you if the provided state keys have changed since the
last run of the script.

We use the `changed` function here to reset the state of the email input when the selected user changes.

```tsx
const selectedUser = view(
  'user',
  Inputs.Table(users, { getRowId: (row) => row.userId })
);
if (changed('user')) {
  set('email', selectedUser.email);
}
const email = view('email', Inputs.Text({ label: 'Update your Email' }));
display(
  <button onClick={async () => setUserEmail(selectedUser.userId, email)}>
    Update
  </button>
);
```

### Trigger

Sometimes you need to trigger the script to rerun even if state has not changed. Typically you do this
when you apply mutations and want to refetch data.

```tsx
display(
  <button
    onClick={async () => {
      await setUserEmail(selectedUser.userId, email);
      // rerun the script so the users table will re-fetch and be updated
      trigger();
    }}
  >
    Update
  </button>
);
```

## Putting it all together

The following example application puts together all of these primitives so you can see how they fit together.

import { Code, Card } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import contactListCode from '/src/examples/apps/contact-list.tsx?raw';
import contactListUsageCode from '/src/examples/contact-list.tsx?raw';
import contactMockCode from '/src/examples/mocks/contacts.ts?raw';
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Contact List App">
    <Code lang="tsx" title="apps/contact-list.tsx" code={contactListCode} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Contact List Component">
    <Code lang="tsx" title="contact-list.tsx" code={contactListUsageCode} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Contact Mock API">
    <Code lang="ts" title="mocks/contacts.ts" code={contactMockCode} />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**See it live:**

import ContactList from '/src/examples/contact-list.tsx';

<Card>
  <ContactList client:only="react" />
</Card>
